## The problem

Never again the vicious cycle of not drink enough water causing you to forget to drink more water, then you dehydrated and not being able to remember to drink more water, and you don't even know that you are not thinking straight.

Not on warden's watch, you will drink your water and you will think straight.

## Hydration

It is recommended that you drink 240ml every hour for the first 10 hours of the day upon waking up.

So warden will keen an eye on you during those hours

## How to use

- Hit start when you wake up or set a time when you usually wake up
- The timer will start counting down 10 hours, and for every hour
- For every hour, the cup to drink will accumulate (equation)
- After drink a some water you can choose the amount

  - manual input
  - Take a sip (50ml?)
  - A small cup (150ml)
  - A big cup (300ml)
  - A bottle (500ml)

- The drank amount will subtract the accumulate amount

## Tech

startTime
endTime = startTime + 10 hours

countDown = endTime - currentTime
